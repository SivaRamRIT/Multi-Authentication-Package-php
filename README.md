<h4>Steps</h4>

<h5>Pdf417 Barcode</h5>

<p>I added a little code to <a href='https://github.com/PeculiarVentures/js-zxing-pdf417'>js-zxing-pdf417</a> so that, a webcam can be used to read the barcode. Also I used <a href='https://github.com/meltingice/CamanJS'>CamanJS</a> to manipulate image from webcam in case the default image is not readable by the library. As an alternate method, an image can be uploaded too.</p>

<h6>Requirements:</h6> <p> Since the library needs an excellant quality image to work, a webcam with manual focus would be more appropriate to get a sharper image.</p>

<p>Refer pdf417-example.php to see the complete usage of authentication</p>

<h5>Code39 Barcode</h5>

<p>Code39 Barcode type is found in most of the US college IDs. This package can be used to login the user using thier college IDs. Refer to code39-example.php to see the full usage</p>

<a href='https://github.com/serratus/quaggaJS'>QuaggaJS</a> is used to read the barcode. This library can be used to read other types of 1D barcode like code 128, EAN 8, etc. See <a href='https://serratus.github.io/quaggaJS/'>here for more information.

<h5>Custom Barcode</h5>

<p>User can be allowed to create thier own barcode for thier logins. Code128 barcode is used in this package. <a href='https://github.com/emberlabs/barcode'>Barcode generator PHP<a></p> is used for the creation of custom barcode. The barcode generated by this library could be read by <a href='https://github.com/serratus/quaggaJS'>QuaggaJS</a>.
